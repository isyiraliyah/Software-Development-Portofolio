<h1>The Best Movies According to Aliyah</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Oceans 8</h3> 
<p>Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Anne Hathaway. Self-explanatory.</p> 

<h3>Spirited Away</h3> 
<p>Hand down the best anime of all time.</p> 

<h3>How to get away with murder</h3> 
<p>I know it's not a movie but this deserves to be on the list.
    I was hooked from the first season til the last.
